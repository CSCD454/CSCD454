You're moving through the woods and hear sounds in the distance...
You moved through the woods and still cannot locate the jail.
As you stumble through the brush you hear a twig snap off to your left, but no one is there.
While walking through the woods you trip on what looks like the leftover arm of some hapless person.
Off in the distance you hear the moan of zombies.
In a moment of rest you hear a group of people walking by and talking about taking what’s needed to survives from others.
As you pause to survey your surroundings you see smoke rising from the closest town.
You are startled by a nearby sound and take off running.
